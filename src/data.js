Then there's the first inoculation, telephone, and industrial arts school (not to brag). Newer firsts include the Big Dig, which set a precedent for smart urban planning around the globe, and of course there's the first social media network (Facebook) too.`,

Some of the "innovation friendly" factors include cultural assets, education centers, transportation, and biking or walking accessibility.

If you’re eating in someone’s home and you tell the host you’re full, it will not only offend them, but you’ll still be served much more. It’s better to say something like “un poco más,” which means just a little bit more. This way, you’ll be served just a small portion more and won’t offend your host.`,
          `Ah, the dreaded false cognate. Cognates are words that sound the same in two different languages and have the same meaning. A false cognate, however, means that words in different languages sound the same but have a very different meaning. So be careful when speaking Spanish that you think you know but don’t, because if you say “embarazada” it actually means you’re pregnant, not embarrassed.`,
